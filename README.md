# LunarGlobe

LunarGlobe is a personal development tree that is a work in progress.
My intent is to design a modular interface that I can use to develop
more complicated Vulkan applications.
Overall, I'd like to eventually create a "demoscene" style application
that can be used to showcase Vulkan features.

## Notice of Copyright

While this is a personal project, it should be seen as an extension
of my work at [LunarG](https://www.lunarg.com) and the
[LunarG VulkanTools repository](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Tools), and
thus as copyrighted by LunarG starting in 2018.


## History

LunarGlobe started out as a remodelling of the
[LunarG Cube demo source](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Tools/tree/master/cube).
It is now split into a library and applications.  The "globe_cube"
application is very similar in behavior to the original LunarG Cube demo.

## Applications

There are several applications currently supported.  The full list can be found in the
[Applications Listing](./apps/README.md).

## Building

Instructions for building this repositor can be found in the [Build.md](./BUILD.md)
file.
